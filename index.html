            <p class="life-header bold">Here's a timeline of Harriet Tubman's life:</p>
            <ul id="tribute-info">
                <li><span class="bold">1822 - </span>Born Araminta Ross,in Dorchester County, Maryland,the daughter of Harriet Green and Benjamin Ross, Tubman had eight siblings</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1833 - </span>At age 12, in an attempt to curtail the beating of a fellow slave who had attempted escape, she sustained a severe blow to the head and suffered debilitating headaches and narcolepsy the rest of her life.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1844 - </span>Although slaves were not legally allowed to marry, Tubman entered a marital union with John Tubman, a free black man, in 1844. She took his name and dubbed herself Harriet.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1849 - </span>Tubman escaped to Philadelphia, only to return to Maryland to rescue her family soon after. Tubman returned to the South several times and helped dozens of people escape. Her success led slaveowners to post a $40,000 reward for her capture or death.

                    Tubman was never caught and never lost a “passenger.”</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1850 - </span>While Tubman saved money from working odd jobs in Philadelphia and Cape May, New Jersey,the U.S. Congress passed the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, which forced law enforcement officials to assist in the capture of escaped slaves – even in states that had outlawed slavery – and heavily punished abetting escape.The law increased risks for those who had escaped slavery, more of whom therefore sought refuge in Southern Ontario, where slavery had been abolished.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1859 - </span>Helped John Brown plan and recruit supporters for his raid on Harpers Ferry.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1859 - </span>Through the Underground Railroad, Tubman learned the towns and transportation routes characterizing the South—information that made her important to Union military commanders during the Civil War. As a Union spy and scout, Tubman often transformed herself into an aging woman. She would wander the streets under Confederate control and learn from the enslaved population about Confederate troop placements and supply lines</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1861- </span>Tubman conducted her last rescue mission in November 1861, as the Civil War enveloped the nation.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1862 - </span>She went to South Carolina to provide badly needed nursing care for black soldiers and newly liberated slaves.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1913 - </span>Died of pneumonia in Auburn,New York</li>
            </ul>
